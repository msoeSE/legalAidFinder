# Legal Help Wisconsin

Legal Help Wisconsin is for people who are handling their civil legal problems without a lawyer. It can help you find the civil legal aid services available to you. This website does not give legal advice and it is not a substitute for having a lawyer. This website does not cover all areas of law but seeks to add new resources over time. Legal Help Wisconsin is a project of the [Wisconsin Access to Justice Commission](http://wisatj.org/).
